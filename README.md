# Universal function approximator
Neural networks are universal function approximators. 
Given enough neurons and layers, a neural network can approximate **any** function.
(I don't really believe this, but I agree that neural networks are very powerful function approximators.)
If you are interested in the proof, you can read the paper [Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators](https://github.com/JIAOJIAOMEI/Universal-function-approximator-and-PINNs/blob/main/1989-Multilayer%20feedforward%20networks%20are%20universal%20approximators.pdf).

# Fourier feature mapping

Fourier's transformation is indeed function approximation.
It can approximate any function with a series of sine and cosine functions.

**Since that Fourier's transformation and neural networks are both function approximators, can we combine them together?**
